## Reflections and comments
 
 * well, I'm finding my self planning and learning doing good so far, since when I planned for something IÂ  keep learning about it till achieve it, I used to measure my self work about the quality of that work and the time consuming,
but there bad thing, that it take a lot of time! but its ok i think its need time cuz I'm still beginner, and good work need good time to accomplish.
I often evaluate what I learn by the things that I've done and how much I satisfied about it!
